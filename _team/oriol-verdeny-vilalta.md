Oriol is the founder of Yovori, an agri-business venture in Benin centered on producing insects for food and feed. Nowadays he channels his expertise and resources towards projects that promise a meaningful and positive change for the natural world and our future, and he is committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.

His background working with insects is diverse and spans both public and private sectors. Oriol holds a PhD in insect ecology from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), and his research journey included immersive stages abroad (USA, Croatia and France). He joined the French start-up Ynsect for almost 7 years, where he worked with an interdisciplinary team that played a significant role in advancing the insect mass rearing industry. He is a veteran in data-driven decision-making, with over 15 years of experience in activities that necessitate rigorous data analysis and modeling to create a solid know-how. He also provides training in data analysis and offers consulting services for various projects of global significance.

His goal is to use this blend of scientific and data analysis expertise, business insight, and dedication to sustainable development to strengthen the link between the field of agri-business and ecological sustainability.
